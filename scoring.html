    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Each restaurant receives a severity score based on its recent inspection history.
      The score determines the badge color displayed on the main page. Higher scores
      indicate more serious or more frequent health code issues.

    <h2>Scoring Rules</h2>
    <p>Scores start at 0 and points are added based on inspection outcomes:</p>

        <tr>
          <th>Condition</th>

    <h2>Restaurant-Level Score</h2>
    <p>
      When a restaurant has multiple inspections, the scores from each inspection are
      combined. A restaurant that is currently operationally closed receives an
      additional +5.0 points, pushing it to the top of severity-sorted results.
