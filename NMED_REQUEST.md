**To:** NMED.Food.Program@env.nm.gov  
**Subject:** Public Records Request - Restaurant Health Inspection Data

Dear NMED Food Safety Program,

I am working on a public service project to aggregate restaurant health inspection data for New Mexico. I am requesting access to food establishment inspection records for the following cities:

- Las Cruces
- Rio Rancho
- Santa Fe
- Roswell
- Farmington
- Hobbs
- Clovis
- Carlsbad
- Alamogordo

**Requested Data:**
- Time period: Past 12 months
- Status filter: Establishments with Conditional Approval, Unsatisfactory, or Closure outcomes
- Include: Establishment name, address, city, inspection date, outcome, violations

**Preferred Format:**
- JSON, CSV, or database export
- Alternatively: API access or scheduled data dumps

**Use Case:** 
Aggregating publicly available health inspection data to help the filming industry identify venues that may be more flexible for short-notice location agreements.

The current system already processes Albuquerque data from public PDFs and is ready to integrate NMED data with minimal development work.

Please let me know if:
1. This data is available for public access
2. What format it can be provided in
3. Any registration or approval process required

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
